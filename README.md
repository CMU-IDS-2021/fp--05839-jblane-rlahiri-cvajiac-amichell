## Summary Image

## Abstract

The Apache Spark framework currently uses a tabular user interface, which offers limited usefulness for users. The project, “A Better Spark User Interface”, considers the short falls of the original interface by creating more intuitive visual encodings and offering clearer insight into the operations of a Spark application. The interface uses two common Spark jobs - a word count and Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) job, and visualizes the implications of using varying optimization techniques to facilitate improving system performance.

## Work distribution

Early in the planning process, the group met to decide on the topic for the project and what type of application would be created. The group then divided the responsibilities of the project and set milestones to meet based on the course assignment turn-in schedule. Each week, they met to assess the progress made on the project and to ask for any assistance if needed. Throughout the course of the project, though members of the team were assigned certain areas to focus on, each member participated in troubleshooting and providing ideas to help contribute to the overall completion of the project.

Riddhiman primarily designed the layout for the main interface page, including the sidebar navigation panel, the dropdown menu for job selection, the checkboxes for selecting the relevant optimization options, and the overall layout features on the main page, including the expanders for displaying the code after performing a particular optimization. 

Janice primarily worked on designing the homepage. This included deciding the overall design, selecting what content would be presented, and integrating fun html features to highlight some of the major points on the page, such as the expanders, the image gallery carousel in the second section, and the image hover feature in the third section.
